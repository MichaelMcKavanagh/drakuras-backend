gameplay:
 - solo world
 - team play? (later)
 - is there an end/victory condition
 - fog of war, imperfect map knowledge with the need to expore as you go...  maybe monsters auto-respawn... as character scouting skill increases, larger parts of the map are explored when ending movement... can attack and explore at the same time. - maybe game tracks how long it's been since a province was scouted
 - at the moment, the character party will just stick together, there may be options for other advanced movement and stuff later
 - at the moment, there might be 'towns' but not player controlled ones... that might be where there are markets or quests available

modules
 - can have multiple maps (planes) within the one module that can be accessed by various means
 - module designer may get a slice of the profits from anyone playing that module (in theory) so that they are encouraged to advertise it and improve it

characters:
 - name
 - race?  (maybe some races have affinities with some skills giving a boost to how fast that skill progresses?)
 - gender?  
 - combat experience
 - mana
 - current combat agressiveness
 - current combat stance 
 - current combat spell settings (maybe multiple spell options can be prioritised to give various options in combat)
 - current combat tactical settings (not sure yet, but maybe an archer can hang back and shoot using archery and movement, while another character may go berserk)
 - current combat other? settings (which may prioritise use of certain skills??)
 - wounds (how should characters recover from death?  - maybe their divinity will restore them to health after X turns)
 - effects
 - movement speed

character skills (all skills an enchance over time, it might cost 1xp for level 1, and 2xp more to get to level 2, etc).  
Some skill points would be awarded automatically through usage, and characters might earn some generic points that can be manually assigned).  
Probably a character has all of these skills at rank 0, and can gain xp in them.  Or maybe they need to be trained somewhere before they start increasing.
Not sure if the game designer would be able to choose the skill list - would be nice if possible though... if so, I'd have to figure out more about
what the skills benefit, and figure out a way for the designer to link the skill name to the effect, and to the mechanism of it increasing.  
How deep is this rabbit hole anyway?
These are just ideas of what skills could be:
 - comradary (gives small boost to all others in the combat)
 - swordsman
 - rage
 - axeman
 - archer
 - swiftfooted
 - resilient
 - tough
 - fire affinity
 - wind affinity
 - water affinity
 - earth affinity
 - strong fire resistance
 - strong wind resistance
 - strong water resistance
 - strong earth resistance
 - summoning
 - scouting
 - alchemy? - creating potions
 - healer? (or enhanced natural healing?)
 

character traits (not all positive)  (how would these be acquired or lost... more for flavour that much else?)
 - temper
 - cowardly
 - etc
 - brave
 - lucky
 - perceptive
 - thoughtful
 - careful
 - cunning
 - greedy
 - reckless

combat stances 
 - maybe some kind of varying combat styles that the player might benefit from if switched around for different situations
 - perhaps the stance could work like a wow warrior, or adom tactics stance (incr defence at the cost of attack, etc)
 - some stances might adjust which way the xp is awarded between skills

combat agressiveness (per character) - meaning some characters could retreat from combat before others, even if they aren't very wounded
 - very cautious
 - somewhat cautious
 - standard
 - agressive
 - very agressive

elemental magic (certain fire/wind/water/earth values are required to unlock spells.  eg: earthquake spell might need earth 10, fire 5 and wind 2)
 - fire
 - wind
 - water
 - earth

magic resistances
 - fire
 - wind
 - water 
 - earth

auras (think status - rank up over time)
 - boost any of the above 

items (items need some indictor of 'power level' to help the loot table system)
 - skill scrolls - add a few xp points to various skills
 - equipment (see equipment slots)  (need restrictions, but mostly based on skills)
 - teleport scrolls
 - summon scrolls
 - provide character effects
 - alchemical herbs
 - potions - might give immediate benefits or apply effects over time
 - portal stones - (used at portal sites to dimensionally switch to another map within the same module)

equipment: note each equipment would also have a 'power level' (think copper, bronze, iron, mithril, platinum, obsidian)
 - weapon
 - head
 - body
 - boots
 - gloves
 - belt
 - left ring
 - right ring
 - necklace
 - mount

monsters: each monster is basically a 'character' with a special monster race, so they can have skills etc.  monsters can also have 'power levels' (eg, copper dragon, bronze dragon, etc)
 - most monster encounters would involve multiple monsters
 - there could be multiple possible combats per hex
 - on monster defeat, think about how xp is awarded per character within combat (used skills gain some xp, also some generic manually spendable xp)
 - monsters could apply effects (usually negative)
 - monsters could have their own combat stances, etc.

loot tables:
 - d&d style loot table, in which defeating say a 'bronze dragon' would generally give you 'bronze' type equipment, however, you could get a bit lucky, or a bit unlucky.
 - currently not planning on having item weights or the need for loot transporting, etc, so probably best if not much loot is awarded per victory

effects - positive or negative, that last over multiple turns
 - weaken
 - strengthen
 - enlightened - minor bonus xp
 - skill boosts
 - poisoning
 - bleeding
 - demoralised

quests (need quest progress tracking, quest reward system - skill boosts? rare/powerful items? gain effects? - how would quests be aquired and handed in? (maybe it is not location specific, but you can only be on one quest at a time, and can just get immediate reward upon completion)
 - killing related: eg: slay X of monster type Y (of at least power level mithril or above) or defeat particular foe
 - item related: collect X extra of item Y  (of at least power level mithril or above)
 - skill related: gain X xp to skill Y
 - travel: travel X tiles  
 - bring me portal stone for dimensional travel? (to another map)

---------------------------------------------------

combat:
 - how does it work in detail, including skills/items/spells....  ????
 - very important to have this interesting, and for the players to have multiple valid strategies and synergies
 - will just be a text combat report, but needs to be more detailed, and better quality than legends
